## **Project Overview**

This document outlines the design and implementation of **intelligent GPS tracking collars**, specifically tailored for two use cases: **ElderGPS** for elderly individuals and **AnimaGPS** for animals. The system ensures safety and tracking reliability, using advanced GPS and GSM modules integrated into durable and ergonomic collars.

The collars are designed by **GeoLink Technologies**, a company specializing in localization technologies. The project incorporates the complete lifecycle from design to production, with components defined and processes implemented using SAP for efficient manufacturing and tracking.

## **Production Details**

### **Material Calculations**
1. **Leather Usage**:
   - ElderGPS: A 150cm x 50cm leather sheet produces approximately 10 straps.
   - AnimaGPS: A 200cm x 150cm sheet yields up to 60 straps.

2. **Plastic Casings**:
   - ElderGPS casings require 100g of ABS per unit, enabling 10 casings per kg.
   - AnimaGPS casings use 50g of ABS per unit, allowing 20 casings per kg.

3. **PCB Production**:
   - A 40cm x 20cm PCB sheet provides 10 PCBs through precise cutting.

### **Workflow**
- Automated and manual assembly stations.
- Post-assembly testing for GPS and GSM modules.
- Final packaging for distribution.
